Projects

· ResNet Project

GitHub

Trained a ResNet-18 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset using PyTorch. Achieved 90% accuracy by implementing data

augmentation, learning rate scheduling, and mixed precision training.

· RAG Chatbot

GitHub

This project implements a simple yet functional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot. The chatbot an-

swers user queries based on the content of a provided research paper (PDF format). It combines text retrieval and

large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses.

· OpenCV and MediaPipe Built a hand detection and a basic game using OpenCV and MediaPipe

GitHub

· CoreML (SAIDL Spring Assignment)

GitHub

Worked on implementing the APL framework by adjusting noise levels and comparing the APL with other frameworks.

· Multi-Modality (SAIDL Spring Assignment) Implemented Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for multi-modality learning.

GitHub

· Miscellaneous

Instructables (profile)
